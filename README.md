# genai-demos
This repo shows a number of small demo's and proofs-of-concept that provide you with a starting point to start experimenting with genAI for your use cases.


```disclaimer: these demo's are provided as is, they do not necessarily work as expected in every possible case. They serve as a starting point for you own experimentations```

## Goal

In this repo, you'll find a number of common examples of using genAI and large language models (llms) in software applications. As llms tend to be both really powerful and mediocre at times, one cannot make (at least to my knowledge) a general statement about how they will perform for a given use case, until one actually builds some PoC to check it.

Take the example of [using an llm to generate SQL queries](free-text-sql-queries/). This demo shows how to use an llm to generate a SQL statement, using the schema of the given database. It contains a simple demo database to play around, and a generic SQL generator based on your own schema.
While it mostly work for the simple demo database, there's no guarantee that it works for your specific schema. With this demo you can quickly find out.


I plan to build more PoCs over time that allow you to quickstart your llm-experiments.
